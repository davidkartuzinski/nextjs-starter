# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Why Next.js?

- **Server-side Rendering**: Improves performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation**: Pre-renders pages at build time
- **API Routes**: Create API endpoints as part of your Next.js app
- **File-based Routing**: Create routes based on your file structure
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Use CSS Modules, Sass, and more

## Installation

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

## Basic Routing

Next.js has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages. When a file is added to the `pages` directory, it's automatically available as a route.

## Conclusion

Next.js provides a great developer experience with all the features you need for production.
