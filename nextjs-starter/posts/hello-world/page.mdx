# Hello World!

This is my first blog post using **MDX** in Next.js!

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, like interactive charts or notifications, and embed them within your content.

## Code Example

```javascript
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greeting('World'));
```

## Using Components in MDX

You can import and use React components directly in your MDX files:

## Conclusion

MDX makes writing content with interactive components easy and fun!
