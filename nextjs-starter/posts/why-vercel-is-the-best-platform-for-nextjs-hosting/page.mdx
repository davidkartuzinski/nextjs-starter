## Introduction

Next.js was **created by Vercel**, and its hosting platform is optimized to get the most out of the framework.

But that doesn’t mean you can’t host elsewhere. Let’s explore your options.

---

## Why Vercel Is Ideal for Next.js

- Built-in support for App Router.
- Serverless Functions and Edge Functions.
- Preview Deployments via Git branches.
- Automatic static optimization and ISR.
- Seamless integration with GitHub.

---

## Other Hosting Providers

You can also host on:

- **Netlify** – great static hosting + serverless, but lacks some SSR edge support.
- **Render** – easy Docker/Node deployments, less focused on Next.js.
- **Cloudflare Pages** – fast edge-based hosting, still maturing for complex SSR.
- **AWS / DigitalOcean** – highly customizable, but much more setup required.

---

## What You May Miss

Hosting outside of Vercel may require:

- Manual routing/configuration.
- Custom server setup.
- No native image or ISR handling.
- Slower preview deployments.

---

## Final Thoughts

While **you can host anywhere**, **Vercel offers the best experience with Next.js** out of the box.
