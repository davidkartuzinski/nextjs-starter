## Introduction

Tailwind is powerful, fast, and popular. But when paired with **Shadcn UI**, it becomes **an unstoppable toolkit** for frontend development in Next.js.

---

## Tailwind Alone

Using Tailwind on its own gives you:

- Utility-first CSS.
- Fully customizable design system.
- Zero-runtime CSS.
- Responsive and mobile-first support.

But it **doesn’t provide actual UI components**. You must build every button, modal, and dropdown yourself.

## Enter Shadcn UI

Shadcn UI provides **accessible, pre-built components**, powered by Radix and styled using Tailwind.

Benefits:

- ✅ Composable and themeable.
- ✅ Uses your own Tailwind config.
- ✅ No vendor lock-in.
- ✅ Easy dark mode support.

---

## Use in Next.js

Just run:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

And your project gains:
• UI primitives like < Button />, < Dialog />, etc.
• Sensible default styles.
• A clean way to organize components.

## Conclusion

Use Tailwind alone for maximum control. Add Shadcn for fast, accessible UI that still respects your design system.
