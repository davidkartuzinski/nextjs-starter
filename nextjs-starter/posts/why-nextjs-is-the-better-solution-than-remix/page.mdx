## Introduction

When deciding between modern React frameworks, two powerful contenders emerge: **Next.js** and **Remix**. Each offers a unique approach to server-side rendering and routing, but for many developers, **Next.js continues to stand out**. Here's why.

---

## Pros of Next.js

- **Vercel Integration**: Seamless deployment, preview branches, and serverless functions.
- **File-based Routing**: Simple, intuitive route setup.
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Mix and match static generation and SSR easily.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Vast plugin and library support.
- **Image Optimization**: Built-in with `next/image`.

---

## Cons of Next.js

- **Opinionated** structure may limit flexibility.
- **Complex configuration** for certain custom builds.

---

## Pros of Remix

- **Built for Web Standards**: Embraces native web APIs.
- **Data Fetching** built around loaders and actions.
- **No bundler lock-in** (can be hosted anywhere).
- **Great for forms and nested routing**.

---

## Cons of Remix

- Smaller ecosystem.
- Can be more verbose in data management.
- Lacks native image optimization and deployment integration.

---

## Final Thoughts

Both frameworks are powerful, but if you're building **scalable production-ready apps with a focus on DX**, **Next.js + Vercel is a proven and supported stack**.
